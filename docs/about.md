Hi, I am Yinan He, I recently graduated from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) with Bachelor's degree in computer science. My interest is in deep learning, machine learning, and computer vision. While studying at NTU, I did a research internship at Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), working on active learning methods for computer vision task. In my senior year, I did my final year project on the topic "Predicting gender from structural and functional connectome via multi-view Graph Neural Networks". Currently I am working on computer vision projects as an AI scientist at SAP.
