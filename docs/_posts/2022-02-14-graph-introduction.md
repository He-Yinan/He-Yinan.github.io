The graph data structure is both widely used in real-life applications and also asked during coding and technical interviews. Before self-studying graphs, I know some basic graph concepts from learning in school. However, I have never attempted summarized graph algorithms or graph coding questions. I am expecting some coding interviews in a few months time, so I think now is the perfect time to do so.

## What is Graph?

A Graph is a non-linear data structure that is made up of nodes and edges. Each node can store some data and nodes are connected by edges.
